Find and delete duplicates posts. There are extensions that allow you find posts with similar content, redirect duplicates to the post you are keeping, etc.

== Description ==
Use the [Fix Duplicates plugin](http://scratch99.com/products/fix-duplicates/) to find and delete duplicates posts. There are extensions that allow you find posts with similar content, redirect duplicates to the post you are keeping, etc.

= Warning =
The purpose of this plugin is to delete duplicates. Extensive testing has been carried out, but you should make sure you have a backup of your database, just in case.

= Extensions =
We currently offer the following premium extensions:
* [Redirection](http://scratch99.com/products/fix-duplicates/redirection/): Gives you the ability to 301 redirect any duplicates being deleted, to the one being kept. This helps preserve your link equity, so that PageRank is passed to a single post rather than just being lost. Or to put it simply: Helps with SEO!

= Compatibility =
* This plugin requires WordPress 2.8 or above.
* I am not currently aware of any compatibility issues with any other WordPress plugins.

= Support =
The free version of this plugin is officially not supported, but if you leave a comment on the plugin's support forum, I'll try to help if I can. A much higher level of support is available for customers who purchase one of the premium extensions.
